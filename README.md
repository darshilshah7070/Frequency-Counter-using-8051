# Frequency-Counter-using-8051



## Overview

The Frequency Counter is a project designed to count the frequency of an unknown signal using the Microcontroller 8051. It measures the number of cycles of a signal that occur per second and displays the result on a 16x2 LCD.

## Features

- Utilizes 8051 microcontroller with 2 timers/counters.
- Distinguishes between timers and counters, utilizing internal and external clocks respectively.
- Input signal provided through pin 3.5 from a function generator.
- Measures the frequency by counting the number of pulses for 1 second.
- Displays the frequency on a 16x2 LCD after calculations.

## Usage

1. Connect the function generator to pin 3.5 of the 8051 microcontroller.
2. Power up the microcontroller.
3. Run the program.
4. The frequency will be displayed on the LCD after the measurement.
